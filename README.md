# DockermanBulkEditor
Small bookmarklets that leverage Unraid's "Dockerman" to bulk add entries for things that require lots of labels.


Use this (https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/) to make the bookmarklet from the chosen JS page. Ensure that the "domain" is updated to your proper TLD.

The URI-Encoded HTML within the JS files is formed from the HTML in *Raw.html

addHomepage.js
  - Designed for adding labels required to make a service visible to the Homepage docker application

addTraefik.js
 - Designed for adding labels required to make a service visible to the Traefik docker application.
